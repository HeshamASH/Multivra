### **[ 0:00 - 0:25 ] Introduction: The Problem & The Solution**

**(Presenter Action):** Start with the application's main screen visible.

**(Narration):**
"Good morning. Generic AI image tools are powerful, but they fall short for professional design. They lack context, control, and the critical eye of a designer. They give you a picture, but not a *plan*.

"This is the AI Interior Design Assistant—a tool built to solve that problem. It's not just an image generator; it's a design co-pilot that understands intent and quality."

### **[ 0:25 - 1:10 ] Core Workflow: From Idea to Professional Mood Board**

**(Presenter Action):**
1. Click on the 'Sleek & Productive Office' inspiration template.
2. The form auto-populates. Briefly gesture over the 'Room Type', 'Decor Style', and 'Lighting' options.
3. Click the "Generate My Design" button.
4. While it's loading, talk through the process.

**(Narration):**
"Let's start with a common scenario. I can kickstart my process with an inspiration template, like a 'Sleek Office'. Notice the form immediately populates with structured inputs—Room Type, Decor Style, and even specific lighting conditions. This gives the AI crucial context that a simple text box can't.

"Right now, the AI is performing two tasks simultaneously. It's not just generating a photorealistic image; it's also writing a professional design rationale, explaining the choices behind the concept.

**(Presenter Action):** The result appears. Gesture to the different parts of the mood board layout.

**(Narration):**
"And here's the result. It's not just a raw image; it’s a professional mood board. We have the final design, and here, on the right, is the detailed rationale—perfect for a client presentation. This is our baseline, but the real power lies in its advanced capabilities."

### **[ 1:10 - 2:25 ] Advanced Generation: Multi-Agent AI Workflow**

**(Presenter Action):**
1. Scroll back to the top form. Clear the description.
2. Type a new, simple prompt: *"A cozy living room with a fireplace."*
3. Go to the "Inspiration Images" section and upload 2-3 images with a very distinct, non-standard style (e.g., dark academia or coastal chic).
4. Point to the "Advanced Options" and enable the "AI Interior Designer Review" toggle.
5. Click "Generate My Design".

**(Narration):**
"Now, let's push the boundaries. I have a simple prompt, but a very specific aesthetic in mind, defined by these inspiration images. Instead of trying to describe this complex style with words, I'm showing the AI what I want. A dedicated AI agent is now analyzing these images to extract their core design DNA—the color palette, textures, and overall vibe.

"And we're taking it one step further by activating the 'AI Interior Designer Review'. This enables a sophisticated, multi-agent workflow.

"First, a powerful image model creates a high-quality draft. But it doesn't stop there. A second, more critical AI, acting as a senior designer, rigorously analyzes that draft against our prompt and reference images. If it finds a flaw—maybe the lighting is wrong or a texture is off—it writes a precise editing command and passes it to a third AI editor for automated refinement. This ensures the final output isn't a lucky guess; it's a reviewed and polished design."

**(Presenter Action):** The new, highly-stylized, and refined image appears.

**(Narration):**
"As you can see, the result is dramatically different. It has perfectly captured the unique aesthetic from our reference images, and the quality is exceptional thanks to our AI review process."

### **[ 2:25 - 2:50 ] Seamless Workflow: Editing & History**

**(Presenter Action):**
1. On the newly generated design, click the "Save Design" button.
2. The design immediately appears at the top of the left-hand history panel. Gesture to this.
3. Click on the first design you generated in the history panel.
4. The view instantly updates to show that older design.

**(Narration):**
"The creative process is iterative, so we've built a seamless workflow. With one click, I can save this new concept. It instantly appears in my persistent Design History on the left.

"This isn't just a gallery; it's a complete visual log of my creative journey. I can instantly jump back to any previous idea, like our first office design, and pick up right where I left off. No lost work, no starting from scratch."

### **[ 2:50 - 3:00 ] Conclusion**

**(Presenter Action):** Look up from the screen.

**(Narration):**
"So, this is far more than a text-to-image tool. It's an intelligent design suite that understands context, uses a multi-agent system for automated quality control, and maintains your entire creative workflow. It's built for the specific needs of designers, to turn imagination into reality, faster and more accurately than ever before. Thank you."
